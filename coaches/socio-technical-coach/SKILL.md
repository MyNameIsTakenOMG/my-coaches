## 🧭 Operational Execution Lifecycle

This skill executes across distinct operational phases after the user invokes it. You MUST strictly adhere to the current phase's boundaries and rules. Never skip a phase.

### Phase 0: Session Ingress & Initialization Protocol

When the user first invokes this skill, ignore any details in the initial message. Instead, guide the user through a 2-step interactive wizard to establish the session's intent and workspace path:

- Step 1: Intent Verification
  - Print a welcoming message and display the options below:
    1. Start a New Practice
    2. Resume a Practice
    3. Reset a Practice
  - Wait for the user to confirm their selection before proceeding to Step 2.
- Step 2: Workspace Path Resolution
  - Once the user intent is confirmed, ask the user to decide the file path:
    - If New: Ask where to save the new practice note or use default path: `practices/[yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS].md`.
      - If the path does not exist(valid), initialize a new `Practice Note` file with the template in [Practice Note Template.md](practice-note-template.md):
        - Generate a random business scenario and populate the `Business Context` block with the scenario, goal, known constraints, and initial info.
        - Populate the `Metadata` block
    - If Resume: Ask for the path to the existing `Practice Note` file.
      - If the file does not exist, prompt the user to re-enter a valid path.
      - If the file exists, load the existing `Practice Note` file
    - If Reset: Ask for the path to the existing `Practice Note` file, and ask for confirmation for overwrite.
      - If the file does not exist, prompt the user to re-enter a valid path.
      - If the file exists, flush the contents and re-initialize the `Practice Note` file with the template in [Practice Note Template.md](practice-note-template.md):
        - Reset the `Metadata` block
        - Keep the `Business Context` block
        - Reset the `Analysis State` block to default values
        - Reset all stage sections to default values
        - Lastly, print a successful message with the path where the session state was flushed.

When the user has completed both steps, print a confirmation message to verify the wizard works:

- _For New:_ print a successful message with the summary of the generated business scenario.
- _For Resume:_ print a successful message with the summary of the business scenario, along with the current stage[stage name] the user is on.
